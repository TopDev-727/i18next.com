title: "i18next: internationalization framework"
---

Currently we work hard on getting out [v2.0.0 of i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next/tree/2.0.0). It's a complete rewrite of the current code base from 2011 and will assert i18next is ready for the next big things that will come.

Current state is **beta**.

Source can be loaded via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next), bower or [downloaded](https://github.com/i18next/i18next/blob/2.0.0/i18next.min.js) from this repo.


```bash
# npm
$ npm install i18next@beta

# bower
$ bower install i18next/i18next#2.0.0
```

---------

We highly encourage maintainers of modules using i18next to migrate to v2.


In our company we already use v2.0.0 in production, so for people starting a new project we recommend directly using v2.

For people already using i18next in production we recommend to wait for first release - but still feel free to play with it and giving early feedback before the release gets finalized.
