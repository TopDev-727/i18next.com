title: "i18next: internationalization framework"
---

i18next is a very popular internationalization framework for browser or any other javascript environment (eg. node.js).

The current v2 release is a big milestone in keeping continuity for your translation projects by keeping a stable, modern API started in 2011.

i18next provides:

- Flexible connection to backend (loading translations via xhr, ...)
- Optional caching, user language detection, ...
- Proper pluralizations
- Translation context
- Nesting, Variable replacement
- Flexibility: prefer keybased or gettext style? No problem...
- ...

- [Migration Guide from v1.11.x](http://i18next.github.io/i18next.com/docs/migration/)



Our focus is providing the core to building a booming ecosystem. Independent of the building blocks you choose, be it react, angular or even good old jquery proper translation capabilities are just one [step away](http://i18next.github.io/i18next.com/docs/ecosystem/#frameworks).
