title: "i18next: internationalization framework"
---

Currently i work hard on getting out v2.0.0 of i18next. It's a complete rewrite of the current code base and will assert i18next is ready for the next things that will come.

Current state is still alpha - but i highly encourage maintainers of modules using i18next - to take the early chance to play with the upcoming version and starting to migrate to v2.

For people using i18next in production i recommend waiting for first beta version to play around.
